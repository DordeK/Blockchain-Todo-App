# Blockchain-Todo-App
My First Blockchain App Using Ethereum Smart Contracts and Solidity


What is a better way to learn somehing new then creating todo app with that technology.
That is why i created todo app where taks are stored in a smart contract on etherium Blockchain.


Smart contract was writen in Solidity, during development i used ->
https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/ -> whith ganache i created my own private Ethereum blockchain so i could test my app.
https://trufflesuite.com/ -> with trufflesuite i spinup project structure from where i started.
https://mochajs.org/ -> a little bit of testing with mochajs
metamsk -> i used metamask to interact with my private Ethereum blockchain through a browser extension
